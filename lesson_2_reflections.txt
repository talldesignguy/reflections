What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git will create the hidden directory .git and add the required metadata into that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area provides some control over what files actutally get committed with your commit. 
this allows you to leave out files that arent needed or are maybe being worked on before
committing them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by using git diff you can see what changes have been made since the
comparison is between the working directory and the staging area.
