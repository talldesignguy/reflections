When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason would be when you are working with multiple people on the same code. 
Another would be if you regularly work on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

manually pulling/pushing changes give you the flexability to decide when code is
appropriate to push/pull.  you may not want to push code to a public repository
if that code is not ready for the public to see. Likewise you may not want to pull all changes
from a a repository if there are multiple people working on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a branch is a different line of your code.  could be a different project you want to work on
in the same program or just a plce to try something differnt.

a clone is simply a copy of a repository.  can be local or remote

a fork is a copy of a repository but only in the context of github

--

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

this allows git to know if your local commit history is out of sync with the remote
repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

There are some online sites that let you write code online together with friends or coworkers,
but that doesnt seem to be very efficient in the case of running and testing your code.

collaborating using git and gitHub would allow you to work in your own environment that is
familiar and configured the way you like.
